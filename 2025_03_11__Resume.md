## Work experience

### **Optum(@UnitedHealth Group)** *Gurugram, Haryana, India* *(June 2021 - Present)*

**Senior Software Engineer** *(February 2023 - present)* *Gurugram, Haryana, India*

- **Built a framework for performing analytics/bulk jobs**: Designed and implemented an event driven framework based on map-reduce paradigm and master-worker framework for performing bulk jobs on our patient and appointment data corpus. It has the capability to scale horizontally and vertically based on the job requirements and is highly configurable for the same. For the following jobs it has ***achieved transaction throughput of >3 million transactions per hour***:
    - Patient data re-indexing
    - Data synchronization and analysis with externally onboarded healthcare organizations
    - Patient data re-encryption for enhanced data security and breach remediation
- **Drug interaction checker for pharmacies**:
    - Pioneered the development for patient EHR on-boarding and ML-based analytics of patient prescriptions for insurance companies and pharmacies
    - This was done to analyze adverse drug interactions and provide a detailed risk report to the pharmacy outlets, healthcare providers and insurance providers at early stages of healthcare delivery
    - Capable of flagging drugs which are not covered under the patient's insurance plan
    - Capable of suggesting alternative drugs which are relevant w.r.t. both the patient's prescription and with insurance policies
    - *This has reduced the number of adverse drug interaction reports by >10% and has decreased prescription based insurance claim conflicts by >30%*
- **Patient & Appointment on-boarding project**:
    - Analyzed, optimized and designed the entire core low-level workflow of 'patients and appointment on-boarding' system
    - Led the development of this optimized version of this on-boarding system
    - Outcome was reduced application P99 latency by >80%, a horizontally scalable architecture and reduced associated service costs
- **Slot onboarding for external organizations**: For externally connected healthcare organizations for which provider slots were available externally, I built a system to hash and compare existing slot data within the system with the one fetched in real-time to trigger minimal updates in our consumer databases and search indexes. *This reduced weekly update frequency by >60% hence the cost of calling those external end-points.*
- **Healthcare search improvements**: Was responsible for designing and executing several enhancements to our healthcare search algorithms. Thus *increasing our leads by 10%.*
    - *Fuzzy provider search*: A fuzzy search implementation for provider search workflows for more fluid navigation and searches within the decision tree.
    - *Alternate provider recommendation*: A SVM and kNN based recommender system for generating a list of alternate providers w.r.t. currently selected healthcare provider
- **Built a distributed event delivery platform for inter-service event streaming:** 
    - This allows a seamless event delivery through our business vertical to 
      - multiple cloud providers
      - service clients
      - different business verticals within the organization
- Performed a POC on NLP and AI agent-based decision tree traversal for patients and agents using our healthcare application interfaces and data corpus [ Can't disclose more due to NDA ]
- As a personal achievement in this tenure:
    - I *received a commendation award* from our Director, Archana ‚ùóÔ∏è, in the year '24
    - I *achieved a 2nd rank* during Optum's Public International Hackathon in emerging-tech category

**Software Engineer** *(June 2021 - January 2023)* *Gurugram, Haryana, India*

- **Search engine feed system**: Built an application to allow search engines(initially with Google) to directly use results from our internal healthcare application interfaces. These results were used for populating description details on the search page, whenever an Optum on-boarded healthcare organizations and providers are searched for. This is used to generate direct leads to the healthcare provider's appointment page
- **Decision tree implementation**: Built a more scalable and low-latency graph-database based decision tree implementation. Reduced P95 application latency by 95%(from ~10s to ~0.5s).
- **E2E application streamlining project**: Streamlined and optimized the process of front-end calls to application end-points, **thereby reducing errors(from ~0.3% to ~0.025%)**, improving end-to-end application latency and latency for multiple end-points
- As a personal achievement, I received a commendation award from our Director, Jaibeer Malik, in the year '21

**Technologies used:** RDBMS:MySQL; AuroraDB, MongoDB, Java, Redis, Kafka, Java, Redis, Elasticsearch, Kafka, Debezium, Python, Python open-source libraries, PHP, Laravel, Scripting, Docker, Kubernetes, Neptune Graph database, AWS tools(SQS/SNS, DynamoDB, S3, EC2, Lambda's, MSK and more...), Anaconda, SciKit Learn, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, AWS-Sagemaker

### **DocASAP** *Noida, NCR, India*

**Software Engineer** *(Nov 2020 - May 2021)*

- **Search index synchronization project**:
    - Was responsible for building a reconciliation mechanism for healthcare search-index synchronization causing index-data to become eventually consistent at a faster rate with lesser number of updates and for bulk re-index operations
    - Was responsible for optimizing the healthcare search-index synchronization pipeline. This resulted in ***40% load reduction on re-index API calls***, allowing lesser time needed to reach an eventually consistent state

**Technologies used:** Drools, RDBMS:MySQL, Java, Redis, Kafka, Java, Redis, Elasticsearch, Kafka, Debezium, Docker, Kubernetes

### **Oravel Stays Pvt. Ltd** *Gurugram, Haryana, India*

**Software Engineer** *(July 2019 - Sept 2020)*

- **Dynamic real-time pricing project**: Responsible for building a Revenue Management System, a dynamic pricing dashboard, and associated backend services for pricing the rooms dynamically in real-time. This was done by taking multiple factors(grabbed from periodically scraped metrics from the web, private sources & associated AI insights, eg:nearby events and occupancy of nearby hotels) into account to generate the surge-price for the rooms
- Collaborated in building and maintaining pricing dashboard and backend-services, along with algorithmically managing the hotel room prices. Pricing contributors(such as discounts, deals, surge price and several others) were also tracked and maintained via the same, which were used by our pricing algorithm

**Technologies used:** JavaScript, ReactJS, RDBMS:PostgreSQL, Java, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Redis, Kafka, Docker, Kubernetes

### **ARX Technologies Pvt. Ltd** *Gurugram, Haryana, India*

**Software Intern** *(May 2018 - July 2018)*

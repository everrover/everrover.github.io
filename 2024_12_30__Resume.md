## Work experience

### **Optum(@UnitedHealth Group)** *Gurugram, Haryana, India* *(June 2021 - Present)*

**Senior Software Engineer** *(February 2023 - present)* *Gurugram, Haryana, India*

- **Built a framework for performing bulk jobs**: Designed and implemented an event driven map-reduce framework for performing bulk jobs on our patient and appointment data corpus. It has the capability to scale horizontally and vertically based on the job requirements and is highly configurable for the same. For the following jobs it has ***achieved transaction throughput of >3 million transactions per hour***:
    - Patient data re-indexing
    - Data synchronization and analysis with externally onboarded healthcare organizations
    - Patient data re-encryption for enhanced data security and breach remediation
- **Drug interaction checker for pharmacies**:
    - Pioneered the development for patient EHR on-boarding and analyzing the patient prescriptions for insurance companies and pharmacies [ Can't disclose more due to NDA ]
- Performed a POC on NLP and AI agent-based decision tree traversal for patients and agents using our healthcare application interfaces and data corpus [ Can't disclose more due to NDA ]
- **Patient & Appointment on-boarding project**:
    - Analyzed, optimized and designed the entire core low-level workflow of 'patients and appointment on-boarding' system. Outcome was reduced application P99 latency by >80%, a horizontally scalable architecture and reduced associated service costs.
    - Led the development of this optimized version of this on-boarding system
- **Slot onboarding for external organizations**: For externally connected healthcare organizations for which provider slots were available externally, I built a system to hash and compare existing slot data within the system with the one fetched in real-time to trigger minimal updates in our consumer databases and search indexes. *This reduced weekly update frequency by >60% hence the cost of calling those external end-points.*
- **Healthcare search improvements**: Was responsible for designing and executing several enhancements to our healthcare search algorithms. Thus *increasing our leads by 10%.*
    - *Fuzzy provider search*: A fuzzy search implementation for provider search workflows for more fluid navigation and searches within the decision tree.
    - *Alternate provider recommendation*: A SVM-based recommender system for generating a list of alternate providers w.r.t. currently selected healthcare provider
- As a personal achievement in this tenure:
    - I *received a commendation award* from our Director, Archana ‚ùóÔ∏è, in the year '24
    - I *achieved a 2nd rank* during Optum's Public International Hackathon in emerging-tech category

**Software Engineer** *(June 2021 - January 2023)* *Gurugram, Haryana, India*

- **Search engine feed system**: Built an application to allow search engines(initially with Google) to directly use results from our internal healthcare application interfaces. These results were used for populating description details on the search page, whenever an Optum on-boarded healthcare organizations and providers are searched for. This is used to generate direct leads to the healthcare provider's appointment page
- **Decision tree implementation**: Built a more scalable and low-latency graph-database based decision tree implementation. Reduced P95 application latency by 95%(from ~10s to ~0.5s).
- **E2E application streamlining project**: Streamlined and optimized the process of front-end calls to application end-points, **thereby reducing errors(from ~0.3% to ~0.025%)**, improving end-to-end application latency and latency for multiple end-points
- As a personal achievement, I received a commendation award from our Director, Jaibeer Malik, in the year '21

**Technologies used:** RDBMS:MySQL; AuroraDB, MongoDB, Java, Redis, Kafka, Java, Redis, Elasticsearch, Kafka, Debezium, Python, Python open-source libraries, PHP, Laravel, Scripting, Docker, Kubernetes, Neptune Graph database, AWS tools(SQS/SNS, DynamoDB, S3, EC2, Lambda's, MSK and more...)

### **DocASAP** *Noida, NCR, India*

**Software Engineer** *(Nov 2020 - May 2021)*

- **Search index synchronization project**:
    - Was responsible for building a reconciliation mechanism for healthcare search-index synchronization causing index-data to become eventually consistent at a faster rate with lesser number of updates and for bulk re-index operations
    - Was responsible for optimizing the healthcare search-index synchronization pipeline. This resulted in ***40% load reduction on re-index API calls***, allowing lesser time needed to reach an eventually consistent state

**Technologies used:** Drools, RDBMS:MySQL, Java, Redis, Kafka, Java, Redis, Elasticsearch, Kafka, Debezium, Docker, Kubernetes

### **Oravel Stays Pvt. Ltd** *Gurugram, Haryana, India*

**Software Engineer** *(July 2019 - Sept 2020)*

- **Dynamic real-time pricing project**: Responsible for building a Revenue Management System, a dynamic pricing dashboard, and associated backend services for pricing the rooms dynamically in real-time. This was done by taking multiple factors(grabbed from periodically scraped metrics from the web, private sources & associated AI insights, eg:nearby events and occupancy of nearby hotels) into account to generate the surge-price for the rooms
- Collaborated in building and maintaining pricing dashboard and backend-services, along with algorithmically managing the hotel room prices. Pricing contributors(such as discounts, deals, surge price and several others) were also tracked and maintained via the same, which were used by our pricing algorithm

**Technologies used:** JavaScript, ReactJS, RDBMS:PostgreSQL, Java, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Redis, Kafka, Docker, Kubernetes

### **ARX Technologies Pvt. Ltd** *Gurugram, Haryana, India*

**Software Intern** *(May 2018 - July 2018)*

- Worked as part of the team responsible for building out application end-points and interfaces for mortgage processing and monitoring

**Technologies used:** JavaScript, ReactJS, NodeJS, RDBMS:MySQL, Docker

## Personal projects - All on [Github](https://github.com/everrover/)

- **Github Repository** *(Aug 2018 - Present)*

Please have a look at my Github profile for all details(https://github.com/everrover/). It includes details of my personal learning history. *But to talk about my private repositories we should meet.*

## Research work(currently focused on AI)

- **Analysis, implementation and review of colorization models** *(August 2018 - May 2019)*

Using autoencoder, U-Net based GAN and CNN deep learning architectures, models were built and trained on several datasets. Analysis was done on the results of outputs on test-set along with turing tests and their performance was compared. Using these models, a grayscale image colorization tool was built for others to use.

**Technologies used**: Python, PyTorch, Django, JavaScript, ReactJS, Heroku

## everrover.com - finally ready 😄

Well I have been putting it off since long time. But after hacking🧑‍💻 continuously for last 8 days finally the site is ready and operational. 

There's a **_CMS and an associated backend_** as well. But since the number of pages is very less at the moment I haven't yet deployed them on the server cloud. And so I am only using a static webpage server for time being. For hosting I am using github-pages. For small static sites I feel it's awesome.

I used the most recent available tools and learnt a lot in the process. The following image describes all the tools and languages, which have been used within the site(including backend portion)

I learnt a lot while building it. Not only did I go through documentation of associated technologies(I studied and went through some, way before), but I also learnt some concepts such as image and font optimisation, context API for state management and a lot more. I'll write on these topics in time.

The intention🙂 behind creation is to be able to showcase the endeavours I am pursuing(and recieving feedback), be more accountable and consistent and write not only about information technology but also on other topics such as gaming🎮🎲, books I have read📘, sustainability, technology and nature which I am a sucker for.

Literally I can sit in the lap of mother earth in her lush greenery🌴🌳🌲 for whole day long without any other form of stimulation. The birds🐦, animals🐘 and insects🐛... flowing wind🎐🍃 and flowing water🌊... I just love them all. I never tire of breathing in the fresh air alongside watching and hearing the beautiful sounds of all organisms in nature. 

Well that's all for the first post. 👋.
